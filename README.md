# Healio

This application is a simple activity dashboard that provides users with quick access to their daily health metrics.
It displays four interactive cards, each containing an icon and a label, and every card leads to a dedicated page when tapped.

1. Calories – Opens the calorie tracking page where users can monitor and manage their energy intake.

2. Heart Rate – Navigates to the heart rate monitoring page for viewing heartbeat data and related statistics.

3. Step Count – Directs to the step counter page to track walking activity and progress.

4. Body Temperature – Leads to the body temperature page, showing insights into current measurements.

The cards are styled with rounded edges, centered content, and a clean layout. At the top, the title “Your Activities” introduces the section. This design gives users a structured and visually clear way to reach different health-tracking features with just a tap.
